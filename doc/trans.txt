Version:        

:TransTerm - Open interactive terminal and you can translate anything that you
want. Note: only Vim 8!

:Trans - Translate word under cursor, visual selection. Open special read only
buffer for translation.  Move focus from created buffer to the previous file.

Ideas:
* [ ] Keep translate story
    * [ ] Choose the better translate to save
* [ ] Nice syntax highlighting
* [X] Translate multi line string
* [X] Window position
* [X] Don't create new windows
* [ ] Pass options to function from command
* [ ] Possibility to join lines for translate
* [X] Specify source language -s option
* [X] Bug with translate word after selection
* [X] Bug with new window if I have closed split.
* [X] Possibility to chose translate language based on predefined list
* [?] Split interactive on direction and without direction
* [ ] Folding for translation
* [ ] Tests on TransTerm
* [ ] Tests on TransSelectDirection
* [ ] Update readme
* [ ] Update vim doc
